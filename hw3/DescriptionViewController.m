It moves down at a random angle, bouncing off of a wall it hits. When the star bounces off the paddle or hits the brick, the user earns a point. Once the star hits the brick, the brick disappears. To move the paddle left or right, hit the left or right arrow button every time. If the star hits the bottom of the play screen, the current star disappears and a new star is launched at a random location right under where the bricks are (or were) located. The game goes on until the user hits the 'back' button. The score starts at 0 and the current score is saved once the game starts.";
